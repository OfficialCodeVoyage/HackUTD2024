# **AI-Powered Banking Assistant** 🚀

---

## **Inspiration** 💡  
Banking should be inclusive, accessible, and intuitive for everyone, regardless of physical abilities or location. Imagine a user who is blind, uses a wheelchair, or lives in a remote area—our solution provides them with a voice-enabled AI assistant to simplify their banking experience. The goal is to break barriers and ensure seamless financial management for all.

## **How We Built It** 🛠️  
- **Backend**: Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system leveraging OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model to embed financial transactions and efficiently retrieve relevant data using ChromaDB.  
- **Voice Interaction**: Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) libraries to create an accessible voice assistant.  
- **Savings Advisor**: Used AI-powered analysis to identify spending patterns and provide tailored financial advice.  
- **Mobile App**: Built using React Native for a smooth, cross-platform user experience.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenAI API, ChromaDB, Flask for backend services, and React Native for frontend development.

## **Challenges We Ran Into** ⚡  
- Optimizing embeddings for a mix of structured (transactions) and unstructured (natural language queries) financial data.  
- Handling complex queries like "How can I save for a $15,000 vacation in 18 months?" and generating actionable responses.  
- Ensuring real-time performance while maintaining API rate limits for large datasets.  
- Seamlessly integrating accessibility features for blind and visually impaired users.
